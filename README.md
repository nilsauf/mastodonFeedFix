# mastodonFeedFix -> !NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW! see [#1](https://github.com/nilsauf/mastodonFeedFix/issues/1) for more details
A Tiny Tiny RSS Plugin to render the articles of the mastodon rss feed the way I like it for now: 

The missing title of the [Mastodon]("https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon") RSS feed articles will be set to the first 47 characters and three thrailing dots.
